name: keyword-opportunities
description: When the user wants the best untapped keywords for an app tracked in ASOScan — gap-scored suggestions ranked by opportunity score, each showing which competitors already rank for the term. Also use when the user mentions "what keywords should I target", "find keyword opportunities", "what am I missing", "keyword gaps vs my competitors", or "suggest keywords to add". Can also start tracking the chosen terms. For validating a specific term's volume/difficulty, see keyword-intelligence.

# Keyword Opportunities

Answer "what should I target next?" with ASOScan's pre-computed, opportunity-scored
suggestions — drawn from your metadata, competitors, AI, the category index, and
search data — then track the winners, all from real numbers.

## When to use

- "What keywords should I add / target?"
- "Where are my keyword gaps vs competitors?"
- "Suggest high-opportunity keywords for my app."

## Calling the ASOScan API

Base `https://asoscan.com/api/public/v1` · header `Authorization: Bearer $ASOSCAN_API_KEY`.
JSON, camelCase. If the key is unset, hand off to **asoscan-setup**.

1. **Find the app** — `GET /apps` → use the `id`.
2. **Opportunities** — `GET /apps/{id}/opportunities?country=&limit=50` (**2 credits**,
   limit 1–200). Each row: `{ term, volume, difficulty, opportunityScore,
   competitorRanks[]{ name, rank, isYou } }`. There is **no** "source" field — rank
   by `opportunityScore` and read `competitorRanks` for context (the entry with
   `isYou: true` is the owner; `rank: null` there = you don't rank yet).
3. **(Optional) validate a shortlisted term** — the research call in
   **keyword-intelligence** (8 credits), for a few finalists only.
4. **(Optional) track the picks** — `POST /apps/{id}/keywords` with
   `{ "terms": [...], "country": "US" }` (**2 credits**, needs a **write** key; up
   to 500 terms) → `{ added[], skipped[]{ term, reason } }`.

## How to prioritize

Sort by `opportunityScore`, then sanity-check each candidate:

1. **Relevant?** Would a searcher for this term actually want this app? Drop
   off-topic high-volume terms — irrelevant installs churn.
2. **Winnable?** Is `difficulty` realistic for this app's authority?
3. **A real gap?** In `competitorRanks`, `isYou` has a null/poor rank while rivals
   rank well → the sharpest opportunity.

Group into **Quick wins** (high score, low difficulty, relevant, you don't rank)
and **Watchlist** (promising but harder / needs validation).

## Output template

```
### Keyword opportunities — {App} ({country})   ·  credits left: {remaining}

**Quick wins** (track these)
| Keyword | Volume | Difficulty | Score | You rank? | Rivals ranking |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| … | … | … | … | no | Rival A #4, Rival B #9 |

**Watchlist**
| Keyword | Volume | Difficulty | Score | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|

**Next in ASOScan:** track the quick wins → POST /apps/{id}/keywords (write key),
then place them with `metadata-audit`.
```

If the user approves tracking, call the write endpoint and report `added`/`skipped`.

## Errors, credits & honesty

- `401` → asoscan-setup · `403` = no API access **or** a read-only key on the write
  call (tell them to create a **read + write** key) · `402` out of credits · `429`
  back off · `503` not enabled yet. Opportunities = 2 credits, tracking = 2.
- Present numbers cleanly; never track terms without asking; don't overpromise ranks.
